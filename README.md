# vape_bot

A simple project to track my vaping habits.

This started as a personal experiment — primarily to explore [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) and run a Telegram bot in a Docker container for anytime interaction.

The goal is to evolve this into something useful over time, with:
- 🧠 Analytics and suggestions for reducing intake
- 🐍 A clean, modular Python structure
- 🐳 Easy deployment via Docker

Still early days, but we'll see where it goes!
